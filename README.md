## Getting Started

To ensure the program runs smoothly, you need to perform a couple of setup steps after cloning the repository.

### 1. Set Up the Environment File

First, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store sensitive information such as API keys. Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

### 2. Install Dependencies 

Before running the application, make sure to install all the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: 

```plaintext 
pip install -r requirements.txt 

This command will install all the Python packages listed in requirements.txt, ensuring that all the project's dependencies are met.
